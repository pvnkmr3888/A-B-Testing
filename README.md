# A-B-Testing

A/B testing using Python  to choose the best marketing strategy

A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomized experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a variable (web page, page element, etc.) are shown to different segments of website visitors at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drives business metrics.

Essentially, A/B testing eliminates all the guesswork out of website optimization and enables experience optimizers to make data-backed decisions. 

The version that moves your business metric(s) in the positive direction is known as the ‘winner.’ Implementing the changes of this winning variation on your tested page(s) / element(s) can help optimize your website and increase business ROI. 

The metrics for conversion are unique to each website. For instance, in the case of eCommerce, it may be the sale of the products. Meanwhile, for B2B, it may be the generation of qualified leads.



By conducting a-b testing which is available in pdf and html, we can conclude that

The control campaign resulted in more sales and engagement from the visitors. 

More products were viewed from the control campaign, resulting in more products in the cart and more sales. But the conversation rate of products in the cart is higher in the test campaign. 

The test campaign resulted in more sales according to the products viewed and added to the cart. 

And the control campaign results in more sales overall. So, the Test campaign can be used to market a specific product to a specific audience, and the Control campaign can be used to market multiple products to a wider audience.
